# Roommate Selection & Conflict Resolution: Academic Performance Study

## Overview
Quantitative research examining how housing arrangements influence student success at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology (KNUST), Ghana. This study investigated whether roommate selection methods and conflict management capabilities predict academic performance among undergraduate students.


## Methodology
- **Design**: Descriptive survey research (cross-sectional)
- **Sample**: 329 undergraduate students across all academic years
- **Data Collection**: Online questionnaire with Likert-scale items ([View Survey Data](https://github.com/bwelson/3RD_YEAR/blob/main/dataset.csv))
- **Analysis Tools**: SPSS (chi-square tests, cross-tabulation), Microsoft Excel
- **Timeframe**: Second semester, 2023-2024 academic year

## Key Findings

### ✅ Significant Associations Found

**1. Roommate Selection Method (p=0.015)**
- Students who chose their roommates demonstrated significantly higher academic performance
- 76.7% of first-class students selected their roommates vs. 56.0% of second-class students
- **Implication**: Student autonomy in housing arrangements associates with better outcomes

**2. Conflict Resolution Skills (p=0.001) - Strongest Finding**
- Students finding conflict resolution "easy" comprised 68.6% of top performers
- Conflict *frequency* did not predict performance (p=0.956)
- **Implication**: How students manage disagreements matters more than avoiding conflict

### ❌ No Significant Associations Found

**3. Roommate Relationship Quality (p=0.387)**
- Self-reported relationship ratings did not predict academic outcomes
- Suggests behavioral competencies matter more than affective evaluations

**4. Residential Location (p=0.187)**
- On-campus vs. off-campus living showed no performance difference
- Reflects KNUST context where off-campus housing involves similar shared structures

## Main Conclusions

This study reveals that **structural factors** (roommate selection autonomy) and **behavioral competencies** (conflict resolution skills) predict academic success more strongly than relationship quality or physical location. The findings challenge assumptions that general "good relationships" drive academic outcomes—instead, specific skills and institutional policies matter most.

## Practical Recommendations

### For Universities
- Implement choice-based housing systems allowing student autonomy in roommate selection
- Establish mandatory conflict resolution workshops during orientation
- Create residential mediation programs with trained peer mediators
- Extend support services to off-campus students (72.6% of sample)

### For Students
- Prioritize compatibility in study habits when selecting roommates
- Establish clear expectations early about schedules, cleanliness, and boundaries
- Develop conflict management skills through workshops and practice

### For Researchers
- Conduct longitudinal studies tracking roommate dynamics across semesters
- Use verified academic records rather than self-reported data
- Control for confounding variables (prior preparation, SES, mental health)
- Evaluate intervention effectiveness through quasi-experimental designs

## Study Limitations

- **Sample bias**: 77.2% high performers, 55% third-year students, 72.6% off-campus
- **Cross-sectional design**: Cannot establish causality or examine relationship evolution
- **Self-reported data**: Academic performance not verified through official transcripts
- **Unmeasured confounders**: Prior preparation, study habits, SES, mental health not controlled
- **Convenience sampling**: May not fully represent undergraduate population

## Technical Details

**Statistical Methods**
- Chi-square tests of association (α = 0.05)
- Cross-tabulation analysis
- Categorical data analysis

**Variables**
- *Dependent*: Cumulative Weighted Average (CWA) - 4 categories
- *Independent*: Selection method, conflict resolution difficulty, relationship quality, location
- *Control*: Gender, age, academic year

**Sample Demographics**
- 58.1% male, 41.9% female
- 70.2% aged 20-23
- 61.7% chose roommates, 38.3% randomly assigned
